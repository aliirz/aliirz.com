This year marked the 10th anniversary of the [Code for All](https://codeforall.org/2023/06/05/call-for-proposals-code-for-all-summit-2023/), a premier gathering for civic tech enthusiasts worldwide. The summit provided a unique platform to discuss, explore, and evaluate the impact of civic tech on a global scale. I had the honor of participating in a panel discussion on open-source technology and delivering a lightning talk on one of our community efforts, "Flood Light."

#### The Open-Source Panel: More Than Just Hype

The panel discussion aimed to assess the true replicability of open-source software across civic tech. I was joined by experts like Olivia Vereha from Code for Romania and Xavier Frankline from Code for Africa. We discussed why open-source works, citing examples from organizations like Mozilla and civic tech projects like [Decidim](https://decidim.org/). The consensus was clear: open-source is not just a buzzword; it's a viable approach for civic tech solutions.

#### Flood Light: A Community-Led Crisis Response

In 2022, Pakistan faced a catastrophic climate event that led to widespread devastation. In response, Code for Pakistan launched Flood Light, an initiative to create a comprehensive data platform for flood mapping. My colleague Mubassir Hayat and I shared how this effort successfully mapped over 1,500 relief camps and connected those in need with international donors and volunteers. You can watch the full lightning talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAl-P5i7YSw&list=PL6kG8TTskjRP3Qfkzu10VdAFT-rBY4H-9&index=14).

#### Key Takeaways from Flood Light

We highlighted the transformative power of community-led initiatives in crisis response. The project was a quick solution developed overnight using [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com/), collecting over 2,000 data points through crowdsourcing. This data was then used by the government and aid organizations to provide relief to the affected people.

#### Other Highlights and Future Directions

The summit had several sessions on AI and civic tech, which resonated with our ongoing project, [Legisbot](https://github.com/codeforpakistan/legisbot). It was motivating to see that we are on the right track. I was particularly inspired by Olivia Vereha's stories and look forward to networking more with like-minded organizations like Code for Romania.

#### Conclusion

The Code for All Summit 2023 was an enriching experience that left me motivated to continue our work at Code for Pakistan. The summit served as a reminder of the transformative power of technology when used for the greater good. As we move forward, our focus remains on empowering the community and creating a lasting impact.
