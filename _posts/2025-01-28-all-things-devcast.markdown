I've launched All Things Devcast, my new podcast diving deep into the world of artificial intelligence and software development. This podcast aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and practical implementation in the developer's world.

In each episode, we'll explore practical tips, engage in thought-provoking discussions, and share actionable insights that you can apply to your tech projects. Whether you're a seasoned developer, tech leader, or just someone passionate about staying ahead in the rapidly evolving tech landscape, there's something here for you. The first episode is now live!
