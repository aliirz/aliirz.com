Have you ever wondered what you can do more for your city? Are you a developer with some really good software skills? Do you hunger to solve problems that a common citizen faces?

If you are trying to find an awesome idea to work on in your free time, then look no further because we at [Code for Pakistan](https://codeforpakistan.org/) has this amazing curated list of civic tech ideas on our [Github](https://github.com/codeforpakistan/Project-Ideas). It's an open-source list we are trying to maintain.

Have a really cool idea that you think should be on the list? Feel free to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

If you do end up working on any of the above ideas, please do let me know. I would love to help in any way I can.
