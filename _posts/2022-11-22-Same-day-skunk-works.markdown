I came across this really interesting experiment by [A.E Studio](https://ae.studio). They have taken this initiative to launch a tool every day. Most of us who build Saas for a living understand the importance of skunkworks software. Check out their intiative [Same Day Skunk Works](https://www.samedayskunkworks.com). Maybe you will find the motivation to build that Saas you have been thinking about for a while.
