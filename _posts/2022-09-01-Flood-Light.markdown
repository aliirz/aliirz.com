Pakistan has been hit by the worst flood ever this year. At the time of writing this post, the flood affected a total of over 1.5 million people. Here are a few stats:

| Deaths | INJURED | ROADS DESTROYED | BRIDGES DESTROYED | HOUSES DESTROYED | LIVESTOCK DEATHS |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1061   | 1575    | 3475km          | 157               | 992870           | 727144           |

While many organizations are doing the best they can to assist. Our small team at Code for Pakistan took it upon ourselves to try and crowdsource as much data as we can. Hence floodlight, something we cooked up in a few hours. You can check it out <a href="https://pak-flood.ushahidi.io">here</a>.
