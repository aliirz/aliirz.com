So Recently at [Code for Pakistan](https://codeforpakistan.org) our VP Tech. made it abundantly clear that we ought to watch Uncle Bob's [clean code](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmmYSbUCWJ4x1GO839azG_BBw8rkh-zOj) video lectures. It's a really good series of videos that make you think about the code you write everyday.

This post is not about the video series but rather about the comments I found very true and witty. Whenever Uncle Bob asks the audience to focus on a particular slide the editor cuts away and focuses on the Uncle Bob's face. Still don't know what I am talking about? I will let the following comments explain:

> I love that no matter what background we're coming from, no matter part of the world we are from, we are united in our hatred for the video editor.

> Uncle Bob: look at this piece of code
> Cameraman: ah I think it's the signal for a zoom shot of uncle bob's face

> Uncle Bob: Look at this
> Editor: haha you wish

> "clean code - lesson 2"
> starts talking about the origin on the moon
> camera man points at an empty sofa
> Me: wtf am I watching

> I love the lecture, but I want to make the person who edited the video write on an old chalk blackboard “I will not obscure information” about 5000x

> I have got a big list of slangs for the editor

> Whoever edited this: when he says "look at this" - show the board, not the person!

I hope the comments explain the level of unprofessionalism of the video editing. Thats all for now, keep writing clean code you all!
