I've been quietly working on a personal challenge: 100 days of AI. As part of this journey, I built a chatbot that lets you chat with a PDF file. Using GPT-4 and the Assistants API, my bot can help you interact with the content of any PDF you upload.

I used Bun, Next.js, GPT-4o, and ShadCN/Tailwind. It's been a fun and rewarding experience combining these technologies to create something I've always wanted to.

Here is a demo:
