I recently launched [Zenpad](http://zenpad.aliirz.com), inspired by my search for a distraction-free writing tool that’s straightforward yet powerful. Despite trying various platforms, I found them lacking in simplicity, prompting me to create Zenpad. Designed for writers who value focus, it requires no sign-up or sign-in, embodying the essence of minimalism.

My philosophy is simple: if you can't find the right tool, it's time to build it. Zenpad stands as a testament to this belief, offering a clean, user-centric writing experience. Here’s to celebrating the spirit of open-source innovation and the joy of crafting tools that resonate with our needs.
