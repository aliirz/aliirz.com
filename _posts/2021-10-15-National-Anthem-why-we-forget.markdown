While searching for something entirely different we came across a discussion on [quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-national-anthem-of-Pakistan-remembered-and-understood-by-most-Pakistanis-If-not-why) that prompted us to think, why can't any of us remember our national anthem?

"Wish we had a way of reading the national anthem without having to search for it on google", said Saqib. The rest is history. We immediately bought a [domain](http://www.qomitarana.com/), set up a GitHub [repo](https://github.com/aliirz/qomitarana) and hunted for TTF files for a variant Nastaliq font. Within 30 minutes we deployed [qomitarana.com](http://www.qomitarana.com/)

So the next time you need to remind yourself what our national anthem's words are. Remember it's just a URL away. Oh, and the Qomi Tarana project is open source. Feel free to contribute and make it grow. Pakistan Zindabad!
