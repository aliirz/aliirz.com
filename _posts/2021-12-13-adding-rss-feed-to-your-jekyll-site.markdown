You just built your uber cool jekyll site. You just deployed it on your server. Whats this?! No RSS Feeds! Don't sweat, I got you. See its pretty simple. you just have to do two things.

## Add the jekyll-feed gem to your Gemfile

{% highlight bash %}
gem 'jekyll-feed'
{% endhighlight %}

## Add it to your \_config.yml file under plugins

{% highlight yaml%}
plugins:

- jekyll-feed
  {% endhighlight %}

## Run bundle install

{% highlight bash%}
bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. Once you build or run your website, your RSS feed will be accessible at yoursite.com/feed.xml. You are welcome. ðŸ¦„
